I’m senior in computer sciences.

After that I have started in northwest ESL program, then I went straight to my way to get BS in computer science. I’m from Alahsa, Saudi Arabia. It is a big city that famous for dates (a sweet fruit) I had associated degree in computer sciences and I came here to continue my degree.

My dream job is being a teacher. I have not done any step toward my dream job yet but I’ll. Although I know it is not easy to be a teacher, I have a passion for teaching.   

The interesting thing about me that I went to Dubai this summer with my sibling and I had lots of fun there. Dubai is an amazing place to go.
